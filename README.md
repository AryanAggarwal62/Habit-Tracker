# Habit-Tracker

When it comes to developing healthy habits, an issue that most individuals face is consistency. This can be partially attributed to the lack of visible results, but also because of oneâ€™s forgetfulness; we are all human after all. Additionally, it has been widely researched that the first 21 - 56 days are crucial in turning a healthy practice into a healthy habit. Thus, there is a need to develop a program that keeps individuals accountable by indicating the habits that they need to complete, while also serving as a way for individuals to record health-quality information on a daily basis. This information would include sleep length, calories consumed, macronutrients, weight, physical activity, etc.
